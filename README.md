# Predicting Client attrition through Supervised learning in weight management courses. 

### Abstract: This project explores the prediction of client dropout from a weight management program using machine learning algorithms. The project also explores clients survival analysis.

### Objectives: 
1) Predict client dropout using supervised machine learning techniques like random forests, Artificial Neural networks, Naieve bayes and Logistic regression.
2) Survival analysis for understanding client dropout through kaplan-mier curves and COX's proportionality hazards model
